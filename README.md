# OGSA-PROMs
This is the supporting code for the generation and validation of the OGSA-PROMs-2023 dataset collection: a set of musculoskeletal disorders' public open datasets of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), publicly available on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/12647720.
The generation code cannot be directly executed because it requires access to the unreleased raw data (non-anonymized), while the validation code can be directly executed on the datasets downloaded from Zenodo.
